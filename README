# 7550a_stream

This utility serves to stream data over a serial port to a HP 7550A plotter.
Other HP plotters may also work. It implements flow control by querying
available buffer space in the plotter periodically using HP device control
commands.

This fork adds required delays when using a USB serial adapter with no hardware flush support.

Use the following settings on your 7550A serial config:

 - Data Flow: Remote, Standalone
 - Bypass: Bypass off
 - Handshake: None, Direct
 - Baud: 1200
 - Duplex: Full
 - Parity: 8-bits Odd
